## **Introduction**

Welcome to the new version of [rep-talkNPC](https://github.com/Rep-Scripts/rep-talkNPC). We bring to you a platform with fresh UI designs that are highly configurable, from UI elements to ped features. Please note that this release does not include jobs, and is not a drag-and-drop solution; it is a foundation for you to build upon and integrate with your own npc/job systems.

---

## **Installation**

```
git clone https://github.com/BahnMiFPS/rep-talkNPC.git
cd rep-talkNPC/web
pnpm i
pnpm build
```

Drag and drop the folder into your project and start it in your FiveM server.cfg.

## **How to Use**

### **Examples**

- Refer to `cl_ex.lua` where we've set up a `/testnpc` command enabling you to spawn a sample NPC on your server.
- We have also included the code snippet that we used in the feature video for your future reference.
- _Document will be updated_
